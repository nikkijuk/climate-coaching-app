# climate-coaching-app

Climate coaching-app is an experiment to formulate idea of massive mobile personal coaching platform 

## Goal

Save the world.

But yes: it's good question. It's not clear to me why would anyone use app for climate-coaching and why? who would do content? who would consume it? privately? with community? sharing all? sharing nothing? sharing when finished? sharing thru process or learning? 

It only makes sense to go forword if idea gets so clear that it's possible to implement very focused tool that would be useful and solve some problem.

## coaching program structure

Coaching programs needs to be formulated somehow. How about using markdown, so that each program has always one file as root (aka index.html) and if needed each module could been saved as single file in corresponding subdirectory.

1. Metadata
2. Introduction
3. Modules
  * Module
    * Introduction
    * Lecture 1
    * Test 1
    * (and so on)
    * Summary
    * Further information
4. Summary
5. Further information
6. Credits

Note that this silly idea has following rationale
- coaching program can be written with any tool, there isn't any special authoring tools
- coaching program can be saved to git repository and exported to devices as single jar containing whole repository content
- git would allow versioning, but also co-operation on authoring content

## implementation of coaching apps

Look ma, I found new toy

## next steps

I'll try to iterate and formulate this - let's see - I really don't know if this is good or useful idea
